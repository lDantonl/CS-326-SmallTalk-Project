##Project Assignment 04
What we changed: 

We started to intoduce our avatar:
Shorty the Talk Bot. You can find him in the help page.

added help page:
It is different for users who are logging in and for users who have yet to login.
It's funny, go look at it please

Ajax implementation:
We added the ability to follow/unfollow users without refreshing the page.
More to come: A like/dislike feature, instant search, submitting posts, and more.

Web socket implementation:
We implemented a private chat feature that uses web sockets for instantaneous updates.
More to come: loading new posts, and real-time notifications.

Database:
We implemented a real SQLite database, so that changes/updates are stored. Posts are saved in the database and remain
visible even after the program is restarted. Further implementation is coming soon.
